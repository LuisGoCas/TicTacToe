TicTacToe
=========

This was created upon motivation of a challenge in a series of tutorials in youtube.
It was mostly developed to learn how to work with different files and classes in C++,
thus some of the functionality of some classes could have been achieved in a single main,
which means it has been done this way deliberately.
Despite of being platform specific (Visual Studio) it is easily modifiable to be multiplatform supported


It's a fairly simple customazation of the well known tictactoe Game

Characteristics:
=========
Allows more than 2 players
Each player selects it's own symbol rather than only 'X' and 'O'
Select size of the board nxm matrix from 3x3 to 10x10
and choose the number of marks in order to win
