TicTacToe
=========
### Motivation:

This was created upon motivation of a challenge in a series of tutorials in youtube. <return>
It was mostly developed to learn how to work with different files and classes in C++, <return>
thus some of the functionality of some classes could have been achieved in a single main, <return>
which means it has been done this way deliberately. <return>
Despite of being platform specific (Visual Studio) it is easily modifiable to be multiplatform supported <return>


It's a fairly simple customazation of the well known tictactoe Game

Characteristics:
=========
* Allows more than 2 players
* Each player selects it's own symbol rather than only 'X' and 'O'
* Select size of the board nxm matrix from 3x3 to 10x10
* and choose the number of marks in order to win
